# Fighting Fantasy Dice Roller and Combat Tracker

For the Fighting Fantasy series of gamebooks by Steve Jackson and Ian Livingstone

There are two versions of this: a DOM version that uses standard web elements and animations, and a canvas version that is still a work in progress.

Try them out here:
- [DOM Version](https://fsyth.github.io/fighting-fantasy/dom/www/)
- [Canvas Version (WIP)](https://fsyth.github.io/fighting-fantasy/canvas/www/)

The code is all open source and available on GitHub [here](https://github.com/fsyth/fighting-fantasy).
